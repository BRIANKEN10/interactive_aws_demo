## Description

Eventually, I hope to build out an app that monitors fish counts for sea run fish in Maine. Below is an extremely rough draft of such an app. 

## This is a markdown document! 

We can do all fun markdown stuff in it

```{r random content}

2 + 2 = b

b

```

## We can also embed shiny apps like the one below

embedding is simple although sometimes of glitchy...the code below works in the context of sourcing multiple apps from different directories. 

```{r shiny app, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

shinyAppFile(
  paste0(here(),"/app/app.R"),
  options=list(
    width="100%", height=700
  )
  )


```
